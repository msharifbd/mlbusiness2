There are basically six functions - `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `arrange()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()` - from `dplyr` package of `tidyverse` ecosystem that are very much necessary for data manipulation. These six functions can be used for 80% of data manipulation problems. Additionally, this handout also introduces `ggplot` functions from `tidyverse`. `ggplot` is considered very effective for data visualization. \n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n#install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n#install.packages(\"knitr\")\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n\n# Loading Necessary Packages\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n\n# Data Set for Classroom Practice \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n# Loading Data \n\nproduct <- read_csv(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msharifbd/DATA/main/Al-Bundy_raw-data.csv\"\n)\n```\n\n# Clean the Data Set\n\n```{r}\n# To clean the names of the variables\nproduct <- product %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>% # this function cleans the names of the variables\n  dplyr::rename_all(toupper) # All variable names in upper case\n```\n\n# Meta Data \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you load a data set in R, your next job should be to learn about some characteristics about the data. \n\n```{r}\nglimpse(product)\n\n```\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that there are 14,967 Rows (also called observations) and 14 columns (also called variables). The name of the first variable is `INVOICE_ID`, which type is `chr`, which means it is character type. \n\n# Changing the Types of Variables \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we might need to change the type of the variable; e.g., converting an integer variable to a character variable. In such case, we need to write code.\n\n```{r}\n# Changing the types of Variables \nproduct <- product %>% \n  mutate(\n    DATE = mdy(DATE),\n    PRODUCT_ID = as.character(PRODUCT_ID),\n    SIZE_US = as.character(SIZE_US),\n    MONTH = as.character(MONTH),\n    INVOICE_NO = as.character(INVOICE_NO)\n  )\nglimpse(product)\n```\n\n# Create a New Data Set with Some Variables \n\n\n## 1st (First) verb - `select ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `select ()` function is used to select some **columns** from your data set. For example, if you want to select all variables except `SIZE_EUROPE` and `SIZE_UK` from your data set. Then you should write the following code (We created a new data set called product2)\n\n```{r}\nproduct2 <- product %>% \n  select(\n   -SIZE_EUROPE, - SIZE_UK  \n  )  # 1st Verb\nglimpse(product2)\n```\n\n# `count ()` Function to deal with categorical variables\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know the frequency of different **categorical** variables, we can use the ``count()` function. For example - we want to know whether the dataset includes information about United States; we should write - \n\n```{r}\n# Number of Countries \nproduct %>% \n  count(COUNTRY) \n\n# Number of Years \nproduct %>% \n  count(YEAR)\n\n# Number of Invoices \nproduct %>% \n  count(INVOICE_NO)\n```\n\n**QUESTIONS** - 1. How many products are available in the dataset?\n            2. How many shoe sizes are available in the dataset (use `SIZE_US` variable)\n            \n# Create a new data set that satisfies some rows conditions \n\n## 2nd (Second) verb - `filter ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to subset our dataset by rows, then `filter ()` is used. For example - we want to create a data set that will include only observations for United States, then we should write the following code. The name of the dataset is given `US`.  \n\n```{r}\nUS <- product %>% \n  filter(\n    COUNTRY == \"United States\"\n  )   # 2nd Verb\n\nglimpse(US)\n\n\nGermany <- product %>% \n  filter(\n    COUNTRY == \"Germany\" & YEAR %in% c ('2014', '2015')\n  ) \nglimpse(Germany)\n\ncount (Germany, YEAR)\n```\n\n**QUESTIONS** - 1. Filter those observations that belong to United States and Germany and that are related to Male Gender. \n\n# Average Price of Shoes \n\n## 3rd (Third) verb - `summarize ()` \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `summarize ()` function is used to calculate different statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum value. For example, we want to calculate the average price of all products - \n\n```{r}\nproduct %>% \n  summarize(AVG_PRICE = mean(SALE_PRICE)) # 3rd Verb\n```\n\n\n## 4th (Fourth) verb - `group_by ()` \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `group_by ()` function is very useful when it is used with `summarize ()` function. For example, we want to know the average price for each country; then, we should write the following code - \n\n## 5th (Fifth) verb - `arrange ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `arrange ()`function allows you to reorder your data set by one or more variables.\nFor example, if you want to reorder the average price in difference countries, you need to execute the following code - \n\n```{r}\nproduct %>% \n  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% # 4th Verb \n  summarise(AVG_PRICE = mean(SALE_PRICE)) %>% \n  arrange(AVG_PRICE) # 5th Verb\n```\n**QUESTIONS** - 1. Calculate the average price for both Gender. Who pays greater price?\n2. Calculate the average discount for both Gender. Who gets higher discount?\n3. Calculate the average discount for each month. In which month highest discount is provided?\n\n# Reshaping the Data \n\n## `Tidy` Data \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:\n\n* Each variable must have its own column.\n* Each observation must have its own row.\n* Each value must have its own cell.\n\n```{r tidydataexample, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/tidy-1.png\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n# An example of a Tidy Dataset \ntable1\n```\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipulating tidy data is easy. For example, for dataset `table1`, if we want to measure the rate of, we can do it easily. \n\n```{r}\ntable1 %>% \n  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)\n```\n\n\n\n## `Untidy` Data\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untidy data violate the principle of the tidy data. Therefore, we need to apply analytics to transform it into tidy data. There are two important functions from `tidyr` that can be used to reshape data. The first one is - `pivot_wider` function and the second one is `pivot_longer` function. `pivot_wider` widens a *LONG* data whereas `pivot_longer` lengthens a *WIDE* data.  \n\n```{r pivot, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/pivot.png\")\n```\n\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n# Some Built-in Untidy Datasets\n\ntable2\ntable3\ntable4a\ntable4b\n\n```\n\n### `pivot_longer()`\n\n```{r}\ntable4a %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"cases\")\n```\n```{r}\ntable4b %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"population\")\n```\n\n```{r}\ntidy4a <- table4a %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"cases\")\ntidy4b <- table4b %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"population\")\nleft_join(tidy4a, tidy4b,\n          by = c ('country', 'year'))\n```\n\n### `pivot_wider()`\n\n```{r}\ntable2 %>%\n    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)\n```\n\n## Identify Total Sales by Gender of Each Product (PRODUCT_ID) \n\n### 6th (Sixth) verb - `mutate ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function `mutate ()` is used to create new variables (columns). For example, we want to know the `TOTAL_SALE`, which is the sum of the sum of sale by gender; then, we should write the following code - \n\n```{r}\nproduct %>%\n  count(PRODUCT_ID, GENDER) %>%\n  arrange(-n) %>% \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = GENDER,\n    values_from = n\n  ) %>% \n  rename_all(toupper) %>% \n  rename_at(vars(c(\"MALE\",\"FEMALE\")), ~paste0(.x,\"_SALE\")) %>% \n  mutate(\n    TOTAL_SALE = MALE_SALE + FEMALE_SALE\n  ) %>% # 6th Verb\n  arrange(-TOTAL_SALE)\n```\n\n**QUESTIONS** - 1.

For example, if you want to select all variables except `SIZE_EUROPE` and `SIZE_UK` from your data set. Then you should write the following code (We created a new data set called product2)\n\n```{r}\nproduct2 <- product %>% \n  select(\n   -SIZE_EUROPE, - SIZE_UK  \n  )  # 1st Verb\nglimpse(product2)\n```\n\n# `count ()` Function to deal with categorical variables\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know the frequency of different **categorical** variables, we can use the ``count()` function. For example - we want to know whether the dataset includes information about United States; we should write - \n\n```{r}\n# Number of Countries \nproduct %>% \n  count(COUNTRY) \n\n# Number of Years \nproduct %>% \n  count(YEAR)\n\n# Number of Invoices \nproduct %>% \n  count(INVOICE_NO)\n```\n\n**QUESTIONS** - 1. How many products are available in the dataset?\n            2. How many shoe sizes are available in the dataset (use `SIZE_US` variable)\n            \n# Create a new data set that satisfies some rows conditions \n\n## 2nd (Second) verb - `filter ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to subset our dataset by rows, then `filter ()` is used. For example - we want to create a data set that will include only observations for United States, then we should write the following code. The name of the dataset is given `US`.  \n\n```{r}\nUS <- product %>% \n  filter(\n    COUNTRY == \"United States\"\n  )   # 2nd Verb\n\nglimpse(US)\n\n\nGermany <- product %>% \n  filter(\n    COUNTRY == \"Germany\" & YEAR %in% c ('2014', '2015')\n  ) \nglimpse(Germany)\n\ncount (Germany, YEAR)\n```\n\n**QUESTIONS** - 1. Filter those observations that belong to United States and Germany and that are related to Male Gender. \n\n# Average Price of Shoes \n\n## 3rd (Third) verb - `summarize ()` \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `summarize ()` function is used to calculate different statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum value. For example, we want to calculate the average price of all products - \n\n```{r}\nproduct %>% \n  summarize(AVG_PRICE = mean(SALE_PRICE)) # 3rd Verb\n```\n\n\n## 4th (Fourth) verb - `group_by ()` \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `group_by ()` function is very useful when it is used with `summarize ()` function. For example, we want to know the average price for each country; then, we should write the following code - \n\n## 5th (Fifth) verb - `arrange ()`\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `arrange ()`function allows you to reorder your data set by one or more variables.\nFor example, if you want to reorder the average price in difference countries, you need to execute the following code - \n\n```{r}\nproduct %>% \n  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% # 4th Verb \n  summarise(AVG_PRICE = mean(SALE_PRICE)) %>% \n  arrange(AVG_PRICE) # 5th Verb\n```\n**QUESTIONS** - 1.

Many disciplines around the world are incorporating the knowledge of data science in their day to day operations. The skills employers most frequently seek in data science job posting are `Python`, `R`, and `SQL`. It is hoped that the preliminary discussion in this project will help you to get some idea about `R` in data science. \n\n[^1]:
